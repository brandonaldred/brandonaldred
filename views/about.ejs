                    <p>My title is Marketing Manager, but I prefer something like "creative problem solver." Or maybe even just, "A dude that loves to hustle, provide value, and always keep things moving forward.”</p>
                    <p>A self-taught practitioner of design and marketing for more than 15 years, it all began when I started a web design company in high school with a couple of buddies. I later launched my own successful screen-printing and vinyl shop. In between, I've done a ton of designing, creating, and serving customers, all the while building my skill set, feeding my curiosity and thirst for knowledge, stroking my entrepreneurial spirit, and developing a passion for business.</p>
                    <p>Some things I've learned about myself: I have big ideas. Lots of people have big ideas; I put in the work. I am a huge tech & computer nerd. I'm excited by the creative process. I enjoy solving problems. I thrive in times of chaos and challenge.</p>
                    <p>I create meaningful connections between business' and customers by design. I have a masters in email marketing with a bachelors in social media. I know, I know. There’s no such thing, but these are the environments I like to call home.</p>
                    <p>I'm an open book and love to share my story with the world. I currently do marketing by day and videography/editing by night.
